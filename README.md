# Palindrome-Checker
A recursive function that checks if a mystring is a palindrome. Spaces, punctuation, and uppercase/lowercase will not affect whether a mystring is considered to be a palindrome. 

mystring is a self-made c-string class with added functionality meant to resemble the string class.
