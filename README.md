# Palindrome-Checker
A recursive function that checks if a mystring is a palindrome. Spaces, punctuation, and uppercase/lowercase will not affect whether a mystring is considered to be a palindrome. 

myString is designed to be a string class, adding convenience to and reducing errors of working with c-strings.
